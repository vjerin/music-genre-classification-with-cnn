For this project **Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)** has been appplies.Approach for classification taken is same as image classificication.Spectrograms have been treated as images which on which **image classification** has been done.Input audio is in .wav format(Converted .au provided by GTZAN to .wav format)

With test data 86.77% accuracy is seen.

- Dataset used - GTZAN music dataset (download link - http://opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz)
- Libraries use - Numpy,Keras,librosa,matplotlib,pydub,statistics,PIL,random
- To know how dataset is prepaired look in dataset_preparation.ipynb

Any contribution to improve this project is appreciated
