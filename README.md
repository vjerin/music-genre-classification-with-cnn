With test data 86.77% accuracy is seen.

- Dataset used - GTZAN music dataset (download link - http://opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz)
- Libraries use - Numpy,Keras,librosa,matplotlib,pydub,statistics,PIL,random
- To know how dataset is prepaired look in dataset_preparation.ipynb

Any contribution to improve this project is appreciated
